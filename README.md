# Projet-html-css-1
https://codechampychampy.github.io

Hello everyone, this is my very first HTML/CSS project.

This project is the creation of a website (in french) for photographer Robbie Lens as part of an HTML/CSS course on OpenClassroom,
It includes the creation of a "home page", an "About" page and a "portfolio" page.
